The Metro-Goldwyn-Studios Inc vs Grokster Ltd, was a landmark legal battle in the United States that revolved around copyright infringement in the context of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) file sharing protocols. The case was decided by the Supreme Court in 2005.

- The case involved more than MGM, other major film and music studios, along with the RIAA, sued Grokster, and StreamCast Networks, the distributors of Grokster and Morpheus torrenting software
- The plaintiffs argued that these companies were actively encouraging and profiting from copyright infringement through their software.

2. Inducement Standard
- The central argument was whether Grokster could be held liable for inducing copyright infringement performed by their users.
- The supreme court revisited the standards set in the Betamax case, particularly the Manufacturer's intent and Substantial non-infringing use doctrine

3. Decision
- The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of MGM Studios and the film and music industry, citing that Grokster and StreamCast were liable for copyright violations made by their users
- The court emphasized their reasoning for the decision by stating that the companies actively promoted the use of their software as a means to download illegal copies of media."
