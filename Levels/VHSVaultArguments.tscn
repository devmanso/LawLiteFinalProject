- Sony argued that the Betamax had substantial non-copyright-violating uses, such as time-shifting, allowing viewers to record television programs for later.

2. Fair Use:
- Sony claimed that the time-shifting ability of the Betamax constituted fair-use.
Fair Use is a doctrine which allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rightholders, but only for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, or research.

3. Capability of non-infringing use
- Sony contendded that they should not be held liable for copyright violations performed by Betamax users. They argued that the technology was capable of non-violating use, thus they coudln't be held accountable merely because some users commited copyright infringement"
