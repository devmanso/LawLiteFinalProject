text = "1. Invention of the Betamax
- Sony introduced the Betamax VCR in the 1970s. It allowed users to record TV onto Betamax tapes, which would be played back on a Betamax machine. The tech was groundbreaking as it provided consumers with the ability to time-shift, recording programs to watch at a later, more convenient time.

2. Rise of Home-Video
- The Betamax, along with other VCRs that followed, led to a surge in home recording of television programs. Consumers could now record movies, TV shows, and other content without being bound by traditional broadcast schedules. This was a boon for consumers, because TV schedules no longer interfered with life-schedules.

3. Concerns of Copyright Infringement
- The skyrocketing production and sale of the Betamax (along with other VCR's) raised concerns among the entertainment industry. There was fear that consumers might use VCRs to make illegal copies of copyrighted material, leading to potential losses for these companies.

4. Legal Challenges:
- Universal City Studios and other major film studios like Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against Sony, the manufacturer of Betamax, in 1976. The studios argued that the sale of the Betamax constituted contributory copyright infringement because Sony was providing a tool that could be used to make illegal copies of TV content.

5.  District Court and Appeals Court Decisions:
- The district court initially ruled in favor of the studios, finding Sony liable for contributory copyright infringement. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision, siding with Sony and acknowledging the substantial non-infringing uses of the Betamax. This lead the case to be heard in the Supreme Court.

6. Supreme Court
- The case reached the United States Supreme Court, which ultimately overturned the Ninth Circuit's decision. In a narrow, 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court held that the sale of the Betamax did not constitute copyright infringement because the technology had substantial non-infringing uses, such as time-shifting, which made it useful for non-infringing practices, like recording TV shows to watch at a later date."
